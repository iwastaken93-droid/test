# 💻 Developer Setup & Engineering Guidelines

This document outlines the local setup, tooling configuration, testing standards, and development scripts for extending and maintaining DISSECT.

---

## 📋 Prerequisites
DISSECT is built using modern TypeScript (ESNext target) and utilizes `pnpm` as its primary package manager.
*   **Node.js**: Version 18 or higher (LTS recommended).
*   **Package Manager**: `pnpm` (mandatory rule).

---

## 🚀 Running Commands

Inside the project root directory, run these scripts to execute operations:

### 📦 Package Installation
Bootstrap development libraries and project modules:
```bash
pnpm install
```

### 🏃 Running Locally (Development)
Launches Vite's local dev server at `http://localhost:5173`. Modifying components or styles triggers Hot Module Replacement (HMR) instantly.
```bash
pnpm dev
```

### 🧪 Executing Unit Tests
DISSECT uses **Vitest** for running unit test suites. Run tests with:
```bash
pnpm test
```
The test suite validates parser correctness, CPU emulator execution (registers, flags, virtual memory paging), decompiler AST mapping, and UI utility components.

### 🏗️ Compiling a Production Build
Bundles the code, styles, and template files into the production-ready static assets directory `dist/`:
```bash
pnpm build
```

## 🛠️ Code Styling & Quality Assurance

To ensure codebase cleanliness and standard formatting across files, DISSECT includes:

### Prettier Styling Formatting
Prettier rules are specified in [.prettierrc](file:///C:/Users/NaThA/hacks/antigravity_things/agy/test/.prettierrc) to govern tab sizing, bracket spacing, and quote preferences:
*   **Tab Width**: 2 spaces
*   **Quotes**: Single quotes
*   **Trailing Commas**: ES5 compliance

### ESLint Rules
Linting logic is declared in [eslint.config.js](file:///C:/Users/NaThA/hacks/antigravity_things/agy/test/eslint.config.js) leveraging TypeScript recommended practices.

### TypeScript Compilation Constraints
Configure configurations in [tsconfig.json](file:///C:/Users/NaThA/hacks/antigravity_things/agy/test/tsconfig.json):
*   **Module Resolution**: `node16` / `nodenext` configuration is enforced, which mandates that all relative imports must include standard `.js` file extensions.
*   **Bitness/Bignum Compatibility**: Requires the target version to support native JavaScript ESNext/ES2020 features (specifically `BigInt` operations).
*   **Strict Checks**: `noImplicitAny: true` and `strict: true` settings are turned on to prevent type bypasses.
